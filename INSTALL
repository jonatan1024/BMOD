To build BMOD you will need Bullet SDK (http://code.google.com/p/bullet/downloads/list).

Build Bullet as a static lib. You will need these libs:
  > BulletCollision
  > BulletDynamics
  > LinearMath

Then compile BMOD source code (all .cpp-s) as shared lib.
Link against previously mentioned libs.
Also include following dirs:
  > "amxmodx" form AmxModX SDK
  > "metamod" from MetaMod SDK
  > "dlls", "engine" and "common" from HLSDK
  > "src" from Bullet SDK
